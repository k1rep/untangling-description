            "I want to provide a git diff string of changes to my code, so that I can find the weaknesses in my code and learn more about coding. "
            "But I am not good at Code Review, you need to do a critical Code Review based on the git diff string of changes and my requirements, and tell me what is missing and what can be improved."
            "Attention : Good code is clear, concise, efficient, readable, maintainable, modular, consistent, robust, extensible, secure and test friendly. "
